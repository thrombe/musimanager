plan:
  . for dl - 
    . get keys from newpipe
    . artists have a bunch of keywords they are associated with (like their name in diff languages and stuff)
      . use these to find what artist the key belongs to- look in tags(dont forget to .lower()), author,  
  . manager
    . sometimes, artist names have wierd chard like "/" that cant be in filenames
    . for sorting (by prority)
      . (use the similar strings thing)
      . get info, check following against every artist
        . if song key in artist keywords
        . if song channel key in artist keys from tracker
      . check these in other loop
        . if artist name in song.artist_names
        . if artist name in song tags
        . if artist name in somg titles

current storage needs:
  . tracker - checks if a new album is up and aletrs somehow
    . stores
      . artists
        . artist keys
        . known album keys
      . all artist keys - (this can be generated from artists tho,
          so instead of maintaining it everywhere, just generate it)
  . manager - download and sort musi
    . stores
      . import artist keys from tracker
      . artist name : [keywordas related to artist for sort]
      . known song keys so that its easy to tell whats new/removed

unified storage needs:
  .. can i keep it seperate-ish? so reuse is easy
  . easily editable artist keywords for sort (manager)
    . add keys from artist keys?
      \. will be hard to remove tho
      . maybe artist.show() for debug, that shows what all the keys point to?
  . artists (tracker + manager) (maybe manager should be able to work without this) 
    . artist keys
    . alnum keys
  . song info - for sort stuff (manager)
    . also has local stuff that can used to find new/removed songs

dependency graph thing:
  . options for everything stored in opts
  \. tracker - artist - album - song (songs for putting in playlist or something, not tracking (for now atleast))
  . manager - artist - song
            - np_db_handler

old tracker notes:
  . walk through music, generate a list of artist names, ans add artists manually a few at a time
  . or, take all songs, and get their artist and add it to tracker
  . see if ytmusic.get_artist()["albums"] gives all albums - nope
  . ytmusic.get_album(key){["releaseDate"], ["trackCount"], ["tracks"]}
  . maybe make the first search very long and then, when checking for new, do just top few (search_limit)
  . maybe check song name in known_songs?
  . add song in yt playlist? easy access in newpipe
  . maybe yeet song checks in here so i done have to deal with regional stuff
  . maybe keep search limit to 50 for regular xhecks and increase it to 300 when adding new?

  . Queen Bee - ten - missing (eg holy war)
  . regional content stuff?
