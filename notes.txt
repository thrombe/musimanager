plan:
  . for dl - 
    . get keys from newpipe
    . artists have a bunch of keywords they are associated with (like their name in diff languages and stuff)
      . use these to find what artist the key belongs to- look in tags(dont forget to .lower()), author,  


dependency graph thing:
  . options for everything stored in opts
  . tracker - artist - album - song (songs for putting in playlist or something, not tracking (for now atleast))
  . manager - artist - song
            - np_db_handler

tarcker:
  . walk through music, generate a list of artist names, ans add artists manually a few at a time
  . or, take all songs, and get their artist and add it to tracker
  . see if ytmusic.get_artist()["albums"] gives all albums - nope
  . ytmusic.get_album(key){["releaseDate"], ["trackCount"], ["tracks"]}
  . maybe make the first search very long and then, when checking for new, do just top few (search_limit)
  . maybe check song name in known_songs?
  . add song in yt playlist? easy access in newpipe
  . maybe yeet song checks in here so i done have to deal with regional stuff
  . maybe keep search limit to 50 for regular xhecks and increase it to 300 when adding new?

  . Queen Bee - ten - missing (eg holy war)
  . regional content stuff?
