bugs:
  . remove unnecessary inputs from --add-songs-to-plist-using-song-key
    . asks for clearingbthe plist twice
    . asks for choosing artist name for some reason
  . cant init a new database, it expects that user already has the files there
    . create --init-new-db
  . if download fails -> retry else skip + notify user
    . check if song exists before downloading (to prevent rehdownloading due to crashes)
      . just need to check if there is a file at the required path
      . need to figure out the path tho. maybe find_path() or something
  . np-download should ask for artist name confirming
    . dont forget check-sort after name confirming

plan:
  . add another playlist from which things can be downloaded (replacement for newpipe-download)
  . append-albums-manual whatever - if input == "" then only show artists which dont have any known albums
  . maybe artist.show() for debug, that shows what all the keys point to?
    . like maybe confirm if its the correct artist by showing its albums
  . ytmusic.get_album(key){["releaseDate"], ["trackCount"], ["tracks"]}
  . maybe check song name in known_songs?
  . track songs too?
    . have to wait too long for this to finish
    . Queen Bee - ten - missing (eg holy war)
    . regional content stuff?
  . get songs from newpipe playlist and add it to yt_playlist
    . remove duplicates
    . sort acc to artist or something
  
dev_plan: 
  . add fucking typer
  . allow import of cookies and tokens using cli
  . add hooks/functions for external programs to use this as a microservice/package.
  . allow import from .txt and .json files (idk if this actually exists in the code)
  . make code more atomic (late goal, probably after this is stable.)




dependency graph thing:
  . THIS IS OUT DATED
  \. options for everything stored in opts
  \. tracker - artist - album - song (songs for putting in playlist or something, not tracking (for now atleast))
  \. manager - artist - song
            - np_db_handler
